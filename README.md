# Social Media Ad Rules
If you are a trainer or learning related operater you need to adhere to this.
We will categorize you in the following levels:

- Trusted Level - So You are following rules - You get two days per week to post ads. One per day. Mondays, Wednesdays.
- Warning Level - You follow very basic rules - You get one day per week to post ads. One per day. Mondays only.
- Banned Level - You have not adopted rules and/or You have failed the rules. Zero Ads. Zero Posts.
- Permanent Ban - You failed in a serious way. You ignored the rules. You were given chances to engage one or more times and failed.

# Rule 1 - Adopt the Rules
If not NO ADS for you and after 60 days from confirmation you are not adopting the rules - banned from the group(s).

# Rule 2 - Confirmation of Identity
We are tired of not knowing who to bring up issues to about spam ads or scam ads.
You or anyone representing you - must be verified by three or more of our admins or moderators.

Failure to do this - Delays in doing this - results in "Banned Level" status.
Look - we can respect your desire for some privacy in some situations.
But - you must also understand that in this globally connected world - you cant expect us to believe you hide your identity from your students.
Stop the lame excuses for hiding who does the training or who operates your business.
The process of confirmation by three or more admins is simple.
Apply for "confirmation" of identity and select two additional admins or moderators from these below:

Zeke Torres will always be on the panel of three.
So basically you need to have some other person - vouch for you - speak and confirm who you are.
This has to be done with one or more: Linkedin URL, Phone, Email and/or a zoom call to confirm who you are.

# Rule 3 - Submit Ad's, Messages in advance for Approval.
Your group must follow a consistent set of ads or art to use for promotions.
We are tired of lame ads with zero information.
The Confirmation Panel - requires you submit "ads", "art" that will represent YOUR identity.
If those ads are flawed, wrong, bad - you will be told what to fix before you can be approved to post ads.
If you are confirmed by the panel - and your ads are satisfactory - you are required to maintain a consistent style or look.
Any change to your ads - should be done by seeking the Confirmation team approval as in notifying them you have a 'new design'.
This is done to ensure YOUR ads or information are consistent with the rules.
Ads we do not want are often "I sell stuff send me whatsapp". Those will be rejected.
Ads with useful facts, emails, websites, linkedin etc - are highly highly encouraged.
