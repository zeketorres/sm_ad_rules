## Social Media Ad Rules
If you are a trainer or learning related operater you need to adhere to this.
### We will categorize you in the following levels:

|Level         | Group Topic Status | Sales Ads Benefits                 |
|--------------|--------------------|------------------------------------|
|Trusted       | Able to Post/Reply | One Ad Mondays - One Ad Wednesdays |
|Warning       | Able to Post/Reply | One Ad Mondays Only                |
|Banned 1      | No Posts/Only Reply| No Ads                             |
|Banned 2      | No Posts/No Reply  | No Ads                             |
|Ban Permanent | Out of Group Block | Out of All Groups - Blocked        |


## Rule 1 - Adopt the Rules
When you indicate you seek to post ads - or that we have alerted you to this page - we will track the days it takes for you to acknowledge, apply and agree to the rules.

- We will only give people 60 days to review the rules, ask questions, apply and get approved.
- If you fail to get approved by 60 days - we reserve the right to ban you from the groups.

## Rule 2 - Confirmation of Identity
We are tired of not knowing who to bring up issues to about spam ads or scam ads.
You or anyone representing you - must be verified by three or more of our admins or moderators.

### Failure to do this or any delays in doing this - results in "Banned Level" status.

Look - we can respect your desire for some privacy in some situations.
But - you must also understand that in this globally connected world - you cant expect us to believe you hide your identity from your students.
Stop the lame excuses for hiding who does the training or who operates your business.

The process of confirmation by three or more admins is simple. See Confirmation Steps Below

## Rule 3 - Submit Ad's, Messages in advance for Approval.
Your group must follow a consistent set of ads or art to use for promotions.
We are tired of lame ads with zero information.

The Confirmation Panel - requires you submit "ads", "art" that will represent YOUR identity.
If those ads are flawed, wrong, bad - you will be told what to fix before you can be approved to post ads.
If you are confirmed by the panel - and your ads are satisfactory - you are required to maintain a consistent style or look.
Any change to your ads - should be done by seeking the Confirmation team approval as in notifying them you have a 'new design'.
This is done to ensure YOUR ads or information are consistent with the rules.
Ads we do not want are often "I sell stuff send me whatsapp". Those will be rejected.
Ads with useful facts, emails, websites, linkedin etc - are highly highly encouraged.

## Confirmation Process and Panel
This is a list of Admins or Moderators that will review your request to post ads on FB groups we manage.

You need to have three or more Admins or Moderators approve your request. 
|Name of Admin         |Panel Status      |Role             |
|----------------------|------------------|-----------------|
|Zeke Torres           |Required          |Main Panelist. Required to review all Trainers, Ads for approval |
|Perry Bratis          |Optional          | |
|Stephanie H. Tysinger |Optional          | |
|Pablo Nogueras        |Optional          | |
|Jason Brinkley        |Optional          | |

What you need to do is supply these people with the correct information and ways to verify who you are.
You need to have some other person - vouch for you - speak and confirm who you are.
This has to be done with one or more:
|Item           |Required     |Description                 |
|---------------|-------------|----------------------------|
|Linkedin URL   |Yes          |                            |
|Phone Number   |Yes          |                            |
|Email(s)       |Yes          |                            |
|Zoom/Meeting   |Possible     |Call to confirm who you are.|


Its encouraged that you also supply samples of the ads you will post.
Anything that can help us confirm that your intentions for training and work with students is transparent and reliable.
