## Banned - Soon to be Permanent Ban
PROFILES WE FIND ANNOYING - THEY WILL BE BANNED SOON
These post training ads with no regard to group community and flood board with ads.
These have been asked numerous times to improve their standards and have yet to do so.
The failure of them to improve demonstrates to this group of admins a lack of respect to the community we can not tolerate much longer.

## Rule 1 - Adopt the Rules
When you indicate you seek to post ads - or that we have alerted you to this page - we will track the days it takes for you to acknowledge, apply and agree to the rules.

- We will only give people 60 days to review the rules, ask questions, apply and get approved.
- If you fail to get approved by 60 days - we reserve the right to ban you from the groups.

## Rule 2 - Confirmation of Identity
We are tired of not knowing who to bring up issues to about spam ads or scam ads.
You or anyone representing you - must be verified by three or more of our admins or moderators.

### Failure to do this or any delays in doing this - results in "Banned Level" status.

Look - we can respect your desire for some privacy in some situations.
But - you must also understand that in this globally connected world - you cant expect us to believe you hide your identity from your students.
Stop the lame excuses for hiding who does the training or who operates your business.

The process of confirmation by three or more admins is simple. See Confirmation Steps Below

## Rule 3 - Submit Ad's, Messages in advance for Approval.
Your group must follow a consistent set of ads or art to use for promotions.
We are tired of lame ads with zero information.

The Confirmation Panel - requires you submit "ads", "art" that will represent YOUR identity.
If those ads are flawed, wrong, bad - you will be told what to fix before you can be approved to post ads.
If you are confirmed by the panel - and your ads are satisfactory - you are required to maintain a consistent style or look.
Any change to your ads - should be done by seeking the Confirmation team approval as in notifying them you have a 'new design'.
This is done to ensure YOUR ads or information are consistent with the rules.
Ads we do not want are often "I sell stuff send me whatsapp". Those will be rejected.
Ads with useful facts, emails, websites, linkedin etc - are highly highly encouraged.

## Rule 4 - Mandatory Ad and FB Profile Items
|Item                                  |Rule Description                                                  |    |
|--------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|----|

|Approved Ads via Approved FB Profiles | Your request to get Ad approval must disclose WHich FB profiles respresent you |   |
|You Can Not Block FB Group Admins     | Your profiles can not block or impede FB Group Admins from monitoring your profiles posts |  |
|Ad Software - Relevant to FB Group    | Your ad must be relevant to the FB group purpose. AKA SAS training for SAS Group, NOT SAP |  |
|Divide The Group                      | Your ad/post - should NOT seek someone to join another group - to obtain sales information about your ad |  |


## Rule 5 - Posting Jobs
We encourage posting about a job or role you know is open.
### If your Job Post is flagged by an Admin or Moderator - Likely you need to apply for full Advertising COnfirmation.
Our general rule for Posting Jobs are as follows:
|Item                                 |Rule Description                                                  |    |
|-------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|----|
|Follow Any Other Group Rules         | You must comply with our other group rules and regulations       |    |
|Whatsapp and "Phone" only Not Allowed| Your Ad or post must include useful facts and links to verifiable: Websites, HR people, Linkedin Profiles. Otherwise it may be deemed as spam |   |
|Too Frequent Appear as Fishing       | If you post too many and it appears irregular or suspect - you will be asked to comply with full rules on Ads via Confirmation Process. Otherwise you will be deemed as a spammer. AKA - someone who seeks people private information via suspect job posts.  |   |
* Note: Any member, Admin or Moderator - Is allowed to immediately report your "Job Posting" as suspect and we will remove your post and see if we will required full Confirmation Process.



## Suggestion 1 - Help with Question Posts
Approved Trainers must make an honest effort to participate in group questions and topics that people post related to questions.
This is not a "rule" - but a suggestion.  It is understood that not all trainers can always set aside resources for this.

However it will be observed by all members (including Admins and Moderators) as to if "YOU" are simply here to sell and not help out.
Your participation in the groups is to 'sell' - but we see it as a desire to participate with our community.
Either you are helping the community - or you are not.
One way to help is - helping with questions that newbies and freshers and other members have.


## Confirmation Process and Panel
This is a list of Admins or Moderators that will review your request to post ads on FB groups we manage.

You need to have three or more Admins or Moderators approve your request. 
|Name of Admin         |Panel Status      |Role             |

|Jason Brinkley        |Optional          | |
* these are panelists as of 2/22/2021.  Other panelists will soon be added after they are confirmed as well.

What you need to do is supply these people with the correct information and ways to verify who you are.
You need to have some other person - vouch for you - speak and confirm who you are.
This has to be done with one or more:
|Item               |Required     |Description                 |
