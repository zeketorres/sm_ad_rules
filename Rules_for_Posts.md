### Rules
General rules for boards we admin/moderate.
These are rules for most posts.
If your post is about Sales or Advertising you have more rules to follow.
If you DO CHOOSE TO POST A SALES AD - See Below for Sales Ad Basics.

| Rule                          | Description                                     |
|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| Not Too Often                 | You should NOT post too often. when you do - we get suspicious. The easiest way to think of this... ONE POST PER 24hrs.  Look we know how hard it is to create new and fresh content. We value authors and those who contribute. But we know an ad when we see it. And so do you.|
| No commission links           | We don't allow things like: udemy, korbit, neptune, medium, coursera. If we catch you trying to hide this - we likely will ban/block you.  We get that it's hard to make a living. But if we allow ONE post like this we suddenly need to allow many. And it's all the same ads over and over. |
| No posts or links to PDF's.   | They can have viruses or other suspect issues. Not to mention copyright infringement. We won't allow our group to have social media platform rule violations shut down the group. |
| Use of Images                 | DO NOT Violate Corporate Image Branding Rules. See below on branding. |
| Post Ad in Comments           | DO NOT EVER - Post YOUR Ad or Sales Ad in the comments of SOMEONE else's Ad or Post.|
| Same Ad Different People Post | DO NOT have multiple people post the same message from different profiles in close frequency. We will just deny all of them and consider you all together as spammers. |
| Ban/Block Consequences        | If we banned you on one of our groups - we likely will and have banned you on all of our other groups. |
| Repost something you saw      | You repost a post you saw somewhere else.  Yes yes - that meme you saw was really funny. Now you try to repost from some other group. We also saw it and will now get 50 people trying to post the same. We won't approve all or many of those. Dude - everyone saw the same thing. |
| Post Ads - Not Helping Out    | If you don't contribute in the group with help to questions that are not sales - why should we allow you to post ads or sales posts? So that's why you probably don't get approved.|
| Post about "I Did it!"        | A post about "I have a new certificate" - we just can't allow those.  We are all proud. But we need to focus on our group content.|
| Asking for "Help" Post        | If you ask for "help" - describe the scenario as best you can.  And adding in "Admin please approve". We likely won't approve it. It screams of desperation from common scammers.|
| Whatsapp / Telegram Posts     | If your post only has a "Whatsapp" or "telegram" phone as contact - we very likely WON'T approve it. More info and facts on identity are better. |
| Don't Contact Admins Mods     | Don't try to contact the admins or moderators - we have zero time to debate this stuff.|
| Rename yourself after ban     | Don't try to rename yourself or create a new profile - we monitor group activity with software and other tools. We will notice right away if not eventually. It wont work in your favor.|
| Post under another profile    | Don't have some other friend or someone else on your team start to post your sales message if someone else was banned. We will get around to banning and blocking all of you.|


## Sales Ads
What is a "Sales" or "Advertising" post?
- Things that look like "join a batch".
- Posts about "training" - even if "free" - have an implied "sales" behind it. 

## Sales Ad Basics
- More info is better. Period. The idea is that customers SHOULD NOT have to contact YOU for basic information. So less facts mean we probably will decline the message.
- Less info - you wont get post approved. Keep failing that - we just start to ignore your post and blind decline.
- Violations of Image branding, corporate branding - almost always automatic decline.

| Basic Ad Info to Include    | Description                              |
|-----------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Who is Who                  | Who are/is the trainer? We understand often its not possible to identify. But it is best to include as much information if you can |
| Links (reliable URLs)       | Company Website. Linkedin for People and/or company who you are. In other words - not only how can 'We' verify who you are - but how can your prospective customers. |
| Company Name(s)             | Your company name or if available the name of the intended Trainer(s). |
| More Facts                  | Class Dates, When Class will meet |
| Class Syllabus              | Describe the class and purpose |
| Class Prices                | Give facts on prices and any description on how refunds work or other items customers should be informed about |
| Phone Numbers               | Useful phone numbers. We are not fans of just a post with Whatsap and zero urls. We do understand sometimes that is the only way - but then other facts should be present |
| Reliable URLS               | In general we want people who view your post to be able to have a reliable way to verify your post. That goes for us as admins and moderators too. We often do check posts and the person posting. If we cant see consistent information and facts we may view the person as suspect |



## Image Branding.
Let's use "SAS" as an example.

- If you use the logo and company branding for "SAS" - you need to send proof that you are allowed to use it.  Since you probably DO NOT HAVE authority to use that "SAS'' corporate image - we just decline you. We don't have time to waste in training you on something you should already know.
- Overall - when we see a "SAS" company, corporate logo - we decline "Sales" posts. We get tired of dealing with this issue. So let's not even waste our time.



## Other Basics
These are general topics that explain our decision process for approving posts.
- We try to be consistent - it's not often easy.
- If YOU don't violate rules - we probably will not notice if you violate rules. Really what happens is we can't always be 100 percent consistent with rules.
- If we see you do NOT help and do not contribute to the group - but all we see is you trying to post ads - we notice. We probably WON'T approve your ads.
- We are volunteers and do this in our spare time. Do not try to debate us or take more of our time.


## Common Issues about our Decisions
These are common things we "hear" 


#### "im a freelance trainer and i don't need to have all this rules".
*Yes you do. You wish to be treated as a professional.  We get tired of dealing with your failed customers later that are upset.*


#### "I'm a freelancer trainer with a Full Time Job - i do this on the side so i cant disclose my name or my real job will be upset".
*Then you aren't being professional.  If you don't understand that - too bad we don't have time to be your mentor.*


#### "I'm very good - i have a good reputation i don't need to follow these rules".
*We hear that all the time. But we have zero time to figure out who is who. You either are professional or not. Many other trainers have stepped up. So you need to step up too.*


#### "Let talk to you or email you and explain why this or that..."
*If you contact us to debate these rules - we just ban/block you.  You either KNOW why these rules are important or you are: a. trying to scam. b. immature as a trainer. c. combination of both a and b.*
*We have groups to run and help keep useful conversations going - we can live without your clutter of immature posts.  And besides - we don't see you contributing useful content anyway so we can do without you all together.*
