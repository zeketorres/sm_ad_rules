### FB Profiles we Banned/Blocked
- These profiles violated our rules too many times.
- These have been asked numerous times to improve their standards and have yet to do so.
- Either on our boards or - on boards that are not related to us.
- Basically they may be following rules on our fb groups (or not) but on other groups - they are spamming hard.
- These post training ads with no regard to group community and flood board with ads.
- The failure of them to improve demonstrates to this group of admins a lack of respect to the communities we are on.
- Profiles we have banned and likely will never be allow back in.

They ignored our repeated attempts to follow group rules.
