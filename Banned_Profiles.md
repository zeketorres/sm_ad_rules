### FB Profiles we Banned/Blocked
- These profiles violated our rules too many times.
- These have been asked numerous times to improve their standards and have yet to do so.
- Either on our boards or - on boards that are not related to us.
- Basically they may be following rules on our fb groups (or not) but on other groups - they are spamming hard.
- These post training ads with no regard to group community and flood board with ads.
- The failure of them to improve demonstrates to this group of admins a lack of respect to the communities we are on.
- Profiles we have banned and likely will never be allow back in.

They ignored our repeated attempts to follow group rules.

## Tips and Things to be Aware of
- The ad should post prices.
- The ad should post reliable URL to Linkedin, Web etc for key trainers and service companies.
- The ad should post details of what you might purchase.
- The ad SHOULD NOT ask for your personal email, phone etc - just so you can get that basic information.

## Things to Ask yourself
- IF that 'trainer' is so great - why so desperate to that they post multiple ads a day? They should be busy helping students?
- IF they are so "great" at training - Why no help or zero help to newbie/fresher questions on the group?
- IF they are so "great" at training - Who is the trainer? What are their credentials? Where can you find them to see who is going to train you?

## For "Paid Content" ads...
- Often you can find that information they are selling - if you search. Free. You are paying for something you dont need to pay for.
- PDF's are easily accessible via a search - you are going to pay for something already available.
- Content is often taken from the legit authors and sold - so the author is missing a chance at earning a living. But - that means the author may not wish to create more future content since they see their work taken, stolen.
