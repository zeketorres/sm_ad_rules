### FB Profiles we Banned/Blocked
- These profiles violated our rules too many times.
- These have been asked numerous times to improve their standards and have yet to do so.
- Either on our boards or - on boards that are not related to us.
- Basically they may be following rules on our fb groups (or not) but on other groups - they are spamming hard.
- These post training ads with no regard to group community and flood board with ads.
- The failure of them to improve demonstrates to this group of admins a lack of respect to the communities we are on.
- Profiles we have banned and likely will never be allow back in.

## To other Admins/Moderators
- We have an alliance of groups working together to improve each group quality and content for our members.
- You dont need to be in our group to benefit.
- All we ask is that you consider applying the same style rules and also...
- That you consider these profiles below as ones that have been banned from our groups and likely now hitting your group with spam ads harder.

They ignored our repeated attempts to follow group rules.

## Tips and Things to be Aware of
- The ad should post prices.
- The ad should post reliable URL to Linkedin, Web etc for key trainers and service companies.
- The ad should post details of what you might purchase.
- The ad SHOULD NOT ask for your personal email, phone etc - just so you can get that basic information.

## Things to Ask yourself
- IF that 'trainer' is so great - why so desperate to that they post multiple ads a day? They should be busy helping students?
- IF they are so "great" at training - Why no help or zero help to newbie/fresher questions on the group?
- IF they are so "great" at training - Who is the trainer? What are their credentials? Where can you find them to see who is going to train you?

## For "Paid Content" ads...
- Often you can find that information they are selling - if you search. Free. You are paying for something you dont need to pay for.
- PDF's are easily accessible via a search - you are going to pay for something already available.
- Content is often taken from the legit authors and sold - so the author is missing a chance at earning a living. But - that means the author may not wish to create more future content since they see their work taken, stolen.

## List of Resources We've gathered...

## To Banned - Flawed Trainers
We are NOT against trainers - we work to improve the groups.
- Others have started following our rules.
- Others have adapted and working to improve.
- Your consistent failure to follow our rules got you banned/blocked.
- Even if you follow rules on our groups - but VIOLATE our rules - in other groups we dont manage - that is enough to get you ban/blocked. Your professional behavior is expected in any group.
